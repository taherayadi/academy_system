# Specification Quality Checklist: Staff-Lite Unlock

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass on first validation (2026-09-23).
- The three P1 stories ship together as one coherent increment (unlock + lock +
  regression guard); no story depends on another being built first, but the unlock is
  only commercially correct with the lock in place.
- Enforcement model recorded as an assumption (client-side, consistent with existing
  module gating); the hardened server-side alternative is explicitly out of scope.
- Data safety pinned: lite mode has no payroll write path and never mutates stored
  records (FR-008, SC-004).
